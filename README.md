An [Administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/) plugin to show record change histories from [PaperTrail](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail).

## Requirements

- Ruby on Rails version ~> 5.0
- Administrate version ~> 0.2.2

## Installation

Make sure you already setup [PaperTrail](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail#1b-installation) properly in your project.
Add `administrate-field-paper_trail` to your Gemfile:

```

And then execute:

```

## Usage

Add to your `UserDashboard`:

```ruby
ATTRIBUTE_TYPES = {
  changeset: Field::PaperTrail.with_options(excluded_attributes: %w[created_at updated_at]),
}
```

The `excluded_attributes` option takes an array of string of the attributes you want to exclude from the result.

Then show the data either in your show page like so:

```ruby
SHOW_PAGE_ATTRIBUTES = %i[
  changeset
]
```

Currently, only support to show changes in the show page. Contribution will be appreciated.
